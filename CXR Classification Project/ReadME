## Lung Disease Classification Model
Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying lung diseases from X-ray images. The model distinguishes between Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases using the ResNet50 architecture.

Features
Model Architecture
Base Model: ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet.
Custom Layers: Added GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense layers, and Dropout for better generalization.
Output Layer: Dense layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
Data Preprocessing
Image Data Generator: Utilized Keras' ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation.
Rotation: 10 degrees
Width and Height Shifts: 0.1
Shear: 0.1
Zoom: 0.1
Horizontal Flip: True
Fill Mode: nearest
Callbacks
Custom Model Checkpoint: Saves the model based on both validation accuracy and loss, ensuring minimal overfitting. The model is saved only if validation accuracy is less than 95%.
Early Stopping: Stops training when validation loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall accuracy of the model on the test set.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Calculated for each class.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of the model's performance.
Macro and Weighted Averages: Provided for precision, recall, and F1-score to offer a comprehensive evaluation.
Visualization
Training History: Plots of training and validation accuracy and loss.
Randomized Image Prediction: Visualization of randomly selected images from the test set with their true and predicted labels.
Data Export
Excel Export: Training history, classification report (including macro and weighted averages), and evaluation metrics are exported to an Excel file for further analysis.
